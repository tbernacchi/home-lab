# ðŸŽ¯ Cilium's Service Mesh (eBPF-based) vs. Traditional Sidecar-based (e.g., Istio)

This table compares Cilium's sidecar-less service mesh powered by eBPF with traditional sidecar-based service meshes like Istio (Envoy).

| Feature / Aspect            | Cilium (eBPF-based)                            | Istio (Sidecar-based)                          |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Architecture**           | Sidecar-less (no proxy injected)              | Sidecar proxy (e.g., Envoy) per pod            |
| **Performance**            | High â€” Kernel-level processing via eBPF       | Lower â€” User-space proxy adds latency          |
| **Resource Overhead**      | Minimal â€” No extra containers per pod         | High â€” Sidecar consumes CPU & memory           |
| **Operational Complexity** | Simpler â€” No injection, less moving parts     | Higher â€” Requires sidecar injection & updates  |
| **Networking**             | Native kernel hooks, no iptables              | Relies on iptables and proxy routing           |
| **Security**               | Transparent enforcement with eBPF             | Through proxy-based mutual TLS policies        |
| **Observability**          | Native flow visibility via Hubble             | Via proxy metrics (Envoy, Prometheus, etc.)    |
| **Scalability**            | Efficient â€” lower cost at large scale         | Costly at scale â€” more proxies to manage       |
| **Use of eBPF**            | Yes â€” core technology                         | No (not by default)                            |

âœ… **Conclusion:**  
Cilium provides a modern, sidecar-free approach to service mesh using eBPF, offering better performance, scalability, and simplicity compared to traditional sidecar-based solutions like Istio.
